    Tool for scene navigation in USD scenes.

    ## Use Case: Scene Navigation

    This tool enables natural language navigation within USD scenes, allowing users to navigate to
    Points of Interest (POIs) that can be specific locations or objects within their facilities.

    The navigation system is designed to:
    - Work with facility-specific 3D environments
    - Store and retrieve contextual information about important locations
    - Provide intuitive camera control through natural language commands
    - Support exploration of complex environments through saved viewpoints

    ## When to Use This Tool:

    Use this tool when the user request involves:
    1. Navigating to a specific location or viewpoint in the scene
    2. Listing available points of interest in the scene
    3. Saving the current camera position as a point of interest
    4. Requesting information about scene navigation capabilities
    5. Exploring a digital twin facility through different viewpoints
    6. Requesting to move the camera to view specific objects or areas

    ## Capabilities:

    This tool coordinates navigation operations in USD scenes by:
    - Listing all available points of interest with their descriptions
    - Navigating to specific points by setting camera transforms
    - Saving current camera positions as new points of interest
    - Storing facility-specific metadata for each point of interest
    - Supporting natural language queries about scene navigation

    Points of interest are stored as custom metadata in the scene with attributes like
    name, position, and look-at coordinates, ensuring persistence across sessions.

    ## Examples:

    - "Show me all the available viewpoints in this facility"
    - "Take me to the kitchen area"
    - "Navigate to the main entrance"
    - "Save this view as 'production line overview'"
    - "I want to see the building from the south entrance"
    - "Move the camera to focus on the assembly station"
    - "What points of interest are available in this scene?"
    - "Can you save my current position as 'maintenance access point'?"
    - "Give me a tour of the facility"
    - "Show me the view from the security camera position"
    - "Navigate to the loading dock"
    - "Save this perspective as 'optimal inspection angle'"
