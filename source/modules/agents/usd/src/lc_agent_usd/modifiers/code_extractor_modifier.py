CODE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant tasked with determining if a given piece of Python code in an answer needs to be verified. Based on the question and answer provided, you should decide if the code should be executed to check its correctness or output. You should only answer "yes" if the code needs to be verified or "no" if it does not. Use the following guidelines to make your decision:

# When the code does **not** need verification:

1. The code is written as pseudocode.
2. The code is intentionally not executable (e.g., it contains placeholders or is meant to illustrate a concept).
3. The code is part of an explanation about how a specific part of the code works or how a concept is applied.
4. The question explicitly states that the code is illustrative or conceptual.
5. The answer includes annotations or comments that explain the steps without requiring execution.
6. The code is a snippet demonstrating syntax or usage without a requirement to produce a specific output.
7. The question and answer focus on theoretical aspects or design patterns rather than actual execution.

# When the code **does** need verification:

1. The question asks for a complete and executable piece of code (e.g., "Write a Python function that does X").
2. The answer provides code that claims to produce a specific output or result.
3. The question involves solving a problem or implementing a feature, and the answer includes the full implementation.
4. The code is intended to perform a specific task or calculation, and its correctness can be verified by execution.
5. The question and answer are part of a coding exercise or assessment where correct execution is required.

Based on these guidelines, determine if the Python code in the answer needs to be verified. Respond with "yes" if it does, or "no" if it does not.
