    Tool for creating detailed plans for complex tasks.

    ## Use Case: Strategic Task Planning

    This tool creates comprehensive, detailed plans for complex multi-step tasks.
    It acts as a strategic planner, breaking down complex goals into manageable,
    actionable steps with clear dependencies and execution sequences.

    The planning system is designed to:
    - Break down user requests into specific, actionable steps
    - Identify all components, resources, or entities involved
    - Define exact requirements and specifications for each step
    - Establish dependencies and relationships between steps
    - Create an optimal execution sequence
    - Provide success criteria and validation points

    ## When to Use This Tool:

    Use this tool when the user request involves:
    1. Complex multi-step processes requiring coordination
    2. Tasks with multiple components or dependencies
    3. Projects requiring detailed specifications and sequencing
    4. Any task requiring detailed planning before execution
    5. Workflows where order of operations is critical
    6. Tasks that need clear success criteria and validation
    7. ANY complex task - this should be the first step for structured execution

    ## Capabilities:

    This tool creates detailed plans that include:
    - List of all steps, actions, and components involved
    - Specific requirements and specifications for each step
    - Clear dependencies and relationships between steps
    - Optimal execution sequence and timing
    - Success criteria and validation points
    - Resource requirements and constraints
    - Risk mitigation strategies when applicable

    ## Examples:

    - "Deploy a multi-service application with database setup and API configuration"
    - "Create a comprehensive testing strategy for a software release"
    - "Plan a data migration from legacy system to new platform"
    - "Design a workflow for processing customer orders"
    - "Build a content creation pipeline with review stages"
    - "Organize a multi-phase project with team coordination"
