# omni.ui.Style

Each type of widget has a list of styles you can customize. There are no other style properties exist except the ones listed for each widget. Please don't make up style properties.

Make sure you read the style property explanation before using them. For example, `secondary_color` for CollapsableFrame defines the background color of the CollapsableFrame's header, while `secondary_color` for TreeView defines the color of the resizer between columns.
